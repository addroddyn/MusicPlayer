So, let's get the ball rolling!

I've thought about making a music player for desktop. It would be a relatively small project, for 2-3 people. Ideally, we would be done in three weeks.

Planned features

    Play/Pause, Stop, Next/Prev buttons
    GUI made in WPF instead of WinForms (I'd like this to made in VS, but mostly because I haven't ever used Blender. If someone wants to do it, though, go ahead)
    Display track details
    Handle .wav, .mp3
    Be able to have a playlist
    Add folder/file to playlist

Additional features

(In order of plausibility)

    Multiple playlists
    Support for more files (.flac) for example
    Visualization for tracks (think old Windows Media Player)
    Equalizer
    Skins
